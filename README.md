This project is a book management application where users can register, manage, and view a list of books. The app include:

Registration: New users can create an account by providing their first name, last name, email, and password. The registration form is responsive and centered on the screen.

Login: After registering, users can log in to access their account and the list of books.

Book List: Users can view a list of books. Each book entry is displayed with basic information and can be edited or deleted.

Responsive Design: The app has a clean, user-friendly interface that works across different screen sizes. The form and buttons are designed to adjust automatically on smaller screens.

Error Handling: If there are issues during registration, the app displays error messages to guide the user.

User Authentication: The app communicates with a backend API to handle user registration and authentication securely.
